| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Saturday 9th November  | - Received project<br />- Discussed ideas with Senior Dev<br />- Started on documentation, focusing on Software Development Plan, user flow diagram and Implementation plan. <br />- Outlined tasks in Trello based on documentation so far |
| Sunday 10th November   | - Completed user flow diagram<br />- Researched possible ruby Gems to use within code |
| Tuesday 12th November  | - Documentation approved by Senior Dev <br />- Initiated git and remote GitHub repo<br />- Started coding<br />- Focused on MVP, beginning with basic functions to enable the user to interact with BotDog. Decided to put most of these into specified methods to keep code DRY.<br />- Regular git add, commit and push<br />- Regularly checked and updated Trello board |
| Thursday 14th November | - Continued to work on coding MVP<br />- Trialled using 'asciiart' Ruby Gem on a seperate branch to master in git. Found that the gem was not suitable for the app as the output was not consistent in style and presented problems with sizing in the terminal. Tried several other options to combat this; other Ruby Gems and researched how to reduce the text size in terminal for the 'asciiart' but the time required to create solutions for this was not worth the output. Decided to go with Plan B of coding small ascii style images into the code so size and output could be controlled.<br />- To make the app more fun, I decided to make some of the ascii images animated using seperate .rb files within an images directory in the root directory, the code loops through the files and puts them to the screen.<br />- Added 'colorize' gem to Gemfile and implemented in code to make text elements and options in CLI more visible to user<br />- Added sound bite of dog barking upon open of app. Currently this code only works on Mac so I am going to look into different Ruby Gems to provide a better solution.<br />- Regular git add, commit and push<br />- Regularly checked and updated Trello board |
| Friday 15th November   | - **Halfway Mark: Basic app is running with majority of features implemented. **Happy with progress of app so far and features that have been implemented. There are still some bugs within the code and I need to create a loop/error handling for ARGV.  Planning on completing documentation and bug handling before making any changes to the initial plan for the app.<br/>- Coding begin/rescue into script for error handling<br />- Began designing manual tests <br />- Wrote bash script to run program<br />- Regular git add, commit and push<br />- Regularly checked and updated Trello board |
| Saturday 16th November | - Tested the app and ran into problems with ARGV and gets; I created an if/else to check whether the user has entered their username and prompt for one of they have not. The data in ARGV is then saved into a variable and ARGV cleared to allow gets functionality later in code.<br />- Tested inputting different data types into the command line to use in ARGV and everything seems to be working.<br />- Wrote readme file<br />- Also decided to implement several gems into the code to improve user experience and game play. Senior Dev (Alex) gave some feedback yesterday that the user experience could be improved to better show that something is happening when the user inputs a selection. I had a look at a few options and found a gem that creates a progress bar, I have also decided to clear the screen when the progress bar is 'loading'. I have also implemented voice to add another layer of play and humour to the app. The feed/pat/play loops became quite boring when nothing else happened on top of these. <br />I have also added an easter egg, if the user selects any key other than the menu options, they will be error handled however if they press 8, they will get a joke from BotDog.<br />- I worked on refactoring some of the code as I had several repetitive puts statements in the ASCII art images. I have updated this to a method that takes the number of empty border lines required as an argument<br />- Made the decision to make the app Mac dependent based on the choice of gems I have used. To complement this, I implemented a few more lines of code into my bash script to check the operating system and print out an error message if not mac. If the operating system is Mac, the app will run and set the volume to 50%. |
| Monday 18th November | - Decided to test the app again today and found a bug upon running the application. Details of the voice profile I have selected were being printed to the terminal before the app started. Went through my code and removed a line that I though was necessary for mac-say to function and this has fixed the problem.<br />- Also went through the code to refactor where possible (used string interpolation in several instances) and cleaned up the layout and comments.
